In the final project, I developed a small-scale pharmacy claims data warehouse designed to simulate how insurance and Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) data moves through a real reporting environment. I began by normalizing the raw claims data into a set of 3NF-compliant relational tables, separating the dataset into fact and dimension tables and exporting each one as a CSV. I then loaded these tables into MySQL, where I designated surrogate primary keys, established foreign key relationships, and applied CASCADE and SET NULL rules to maintain referential integrity. This structure supported the creation of a clean star schema, which I documented with a fully labeled ERD showing how claims, members, drugs, copays, and dates connect within the warehouse.

After the warehouse was set up, I built several reporting queries to demonstrate how business users could analyze production-level claims in the future. These included queries for prescription counts by drug, age-group-level utilization summaries using CASE logic, and a window function to identify each member’s most recent prescription and insurance-paid amount. Through this process, I applied SQL techniques for deduplication, schema design, normalization, and analytics while working with realistic healthcare data patterns. The project ultimately allowed me to walk through the full lifecycle of preparing analytical tables, modeling a star schema, and producing BI-ready reporting outputs.
