ALY6030: Data Warehousing SQL

In the ALY 6030 course, I worked through a series of advanced analytics projects that strengthened my ability to translate data into meaningful insights. Throughout these assignments, I applied statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis, predictive techniques, and visualization best practices to real-world datasets. Each project pushed me to think critically about data quality, feature engineering, and how to structure analytical workflows that lead to reliable and interpretable outcomes. By combining SQL, statistical reasoning, and domain context, I learned how to evaluate model performance, compare approaches, and make evidence-based recommendations.

Across these projects, I also gained deeper experience communicating analytical findings in a clear, structured, and business-oriented format. Whether I was evaluating predictors, building machine learning models, or conducting deep-dive exploratory analyses, I focused on explaining why the results mattered and how stakeholders could use them to make informed decisions. This collection of work demonstrates my ability to execute a complete analytics pipeline from data ingestion to actionable insights while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and strong analytical reasoning.
