SQL, Relational Modeling, and Database Normalization

In this project, I deepened my understanding of SQL, relational modeling, and database normalization by working through two major components: a lab exercise using the Sacramento dataset and a multi-part “Tech Crunch” assignment. I began by exploring data modeling concepts such as primary keys, foreign keys, entity relationships, and the differences among 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal forms. Using MySQL Workbench, I imported and examined real estate data, evaluated data types, and wrote SQL queries involving filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation. This portion of the project strengthened my ability to structure data efficiently, understand normalization trade-offs, and translate data requirements into clean, relational tables.

The second component required a full normalization analysis using a TechCrunch funding dataset. I evaluated the dataset’s adherence to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, identified partial and transitive dependencies, and proposed a 3NF-compliant schema. I then applied SQL JOIN logic in a recipes case study, inserting two new recipes and constructing complex multi-table queries that pulled information across normalized tables. This process helped reinforce how relational structures can be reconstructed through JOINs, and it gave me practical experience in data modeling, schema design, and SQL query development within a real-world context.
