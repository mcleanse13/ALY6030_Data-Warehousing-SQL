Dimensional Modeling and SQL Analytics for Hospital Intervention Programs

In this project, I applied foundational concepts of dimensional modeling and SQL analytics to design and analyze a data warehouse scenario for a Hospital Nursing Intervention Pilot Program. Throughout the module, I learned how fact and dimension tables function within a star schema, how to distinguish facts from dimensions, and how schema structure supports high-performance analytical queries. I also worked with SQL CASE statements and window functions to efficiently summarize and interpret hospital performance data across multiple metrics. As part of the assignment, I modeled the relationships between hospital business attributes, bed types, and bed-level facts by identifying primary and foreign keys, selecting appropriate dimensions, and sketching a full star schema using MySQL Workbench.

Using this schema, I executed a series of analytical SQL queries to evaluate hospital capacity and identify suitable candidates for a pilot intervention program. I generated top-10 summary reports for licensed, census, and staffed ICU/SICU beds, then performed a deeper drill-down analysis focusing on hospitals that maintained both ICU and SICU capacity. Based on the results, I synthesized findings and provided leadership-oriented recommendations, ultimately identifying UC Health University Hospital and Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center as the strongest candidates due to their consistent capacity, operational scale, and balanced resource utilization. This project strengthened my ability to design dimensional data structures, write analytical SQL, and translate data insights into actionable recommendations for business decision-makers.
