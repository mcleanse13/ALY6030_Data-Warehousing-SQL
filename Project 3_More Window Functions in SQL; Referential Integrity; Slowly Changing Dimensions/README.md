Dimensional Modeling and SQL Analytics for Public Housing Inspections

In this project, I explored key concepts in data warehousing, specifically referential integrity, primary key design, window functions, and slowly changing dimensions, through the context of public housing inspection data. I began by analyzing the dataset to identify the core facts, determine their additivity, and outline the dimensions needed to support a well-structured star schema. I documented how each fact behaves (additive vs. semi-additive) and mapped out six dimensions that provide the necessary descriptive context for downstream analysis. From there, I walked through how these facts and dimensions should be organized into transactional and snapshot fact tables to meet senior management’s reporting needs at both the individual inspection level and a monthly summary level.

A major component of this project involved working through how to manage real-world data challenges, such as agencies merging or renaming. I justified using a Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension to preserve historical accuracy when agency information changes over time. The final part of the assignment involved building SQL logic using LEAD/LAG window functions and date conversions where needed to isolate public housing agencies with increasing inspection costs. I produced an Excel output and SQL program that identifies each agency’s two most recent inspection costs, calculates the dollar and percent change, and filters out agencies with only one inspection or non-increasing costs. This project strengthened my understanding of dimensional modeling, ETL logic, and analytic SQL, all within a realistic reporting scenario.
